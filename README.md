A Python-based tool that helps protect your eyes by monitoring screen distance and sending alerts when you're too close.

## About The Project

![Product Screenshot](https://example.com/screenshot.png)

Spending long hours in front of screens can strain your eyes and affect your posture. VisionGuard was created to reduce that risk by helping users maintain a healthy distance from their screens.

### Why I Built It

* To help people (especially students and developers) develop healthy screen habits.
* To explore OpenCV and real-time face detection applications.
* To build a meaningful project in a short time frame with a small team.

### What I Learned

* Real-time video processing with OpenCV.
* Face detection and distance estimation using Python.
* How to design alert systems for user interaction.

### What Makes It Stand Out

* Lightweight and easy to use.
* Real-time monitoring and alerts.
* Helpful for anyone who spends long hours in front of a computer.

## Key Features

* Detects user’s face in real-time using webcam.
* Measures the distance between user and screen.
* Alerts when the user is too close.
* Lightweight and fast.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python and pip installed. Then install OpenCV:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/visionguard.git
cd visionguard
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the software:

```bash
python eye_protection.py
```

---

## Usage

Once the script is running:

* Make sure your webcam is enabled.
* Sit in front of the screen.
* If you get too close, the software will alert you to move back.

Ideal for programmers, students, and anyone with extended screen time.
